[Rene Pjengaard](http://twitter.com/pjengaard) and I hosted a talk for the [Umbraco DK Festival 2014](http://our.umbraco.org/events/umbraco-dk-festival-2014) about how we use AngularJS to power the frontend of our Umbraco-powered websites and Skybrud.dk, where I work. 

We got alot of great feedback, so I put the code on github, and thought I would share it here as well... [https://github.com/filipbech/umbdkfest14-angular](https://github.com/filipbech/umbdkfest14-angular).
