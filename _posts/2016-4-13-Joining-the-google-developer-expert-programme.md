*(beware: shameless self-promotion below...)*

I am extremely proud to announce that I'm joining Googles Expert programme. It has been a long-lasting dream of mine to be accepted into this excluse collection of absolutely amazing developers, and getting in is easily the highlight of my professional career. 

As you might know I have been a web-developer for many years, looking, almost in awe, at the good people from Google. Google has brought us not only a superior search-experience, but also provides email-service, a fantastic webbrowser, cheap smartphones for the masses and many unseen inventions. Google has been, and continues to be, the front-runner for the web, and that makes this recognition even more special. 

The official description of the programme states that "The Google Developer Expert Program recognizes and rewards outstanding developers with advanced technical expertise in specific areas who are strong contributors to the developer community, startups and ISVâ€™s.". If you are interested you can read more about the programme and find my profile on the [website](https://developers.google.com/experts/about). 

Im joining as a Google Developer Experts (GDE) of Web Technologies - a group of less than 100 people (2016) worldwide, as only the second Dane. 

Just to be clear, this is NOT a new job - think of it more as an volounteer ambassador-position. Having signed an Non Disclosure Agreement, I will get confidential information ahead of time, and be the users voice inside Google. The Experts meets more than monthly online to discuss technology and future plans and products. There is also the obvious mailing-list and slack-channel. GDEs also gets special invites to Google Events, and to exclusive Expert Summit once a year.   

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the great people of my employeer [IMPACT](http://www.impact.dk), but also my former colleagues (almost family) at amazing [Skybrud.dk](http://www.skybrud.dk). Thanks for believing in me, and giving me a warm environment to grow in!
