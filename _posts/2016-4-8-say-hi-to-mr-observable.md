Last night we had another meetup in our local Angular Usergroup - ngAarhus. 140+ people showed up, and we had a great night of networking, learning, eating and drinking. Perfect! 

I did a talk with an introduction to RxJS and observables, and I just thought I would drop a link to the video-recordring here as well.

If you dont know observables (and understand Danish) I hope this video can help sort things out, and show you the power of the observable. 

You can find more information and documentation about RxJS over on [github](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), and also about [rx.angular](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rx.angular.js/)

Fingers crossed for observables going native...!

Watch the video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MDDIByEeGE).
