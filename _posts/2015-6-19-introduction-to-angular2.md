title: Introduction to Angular 2.0

Last night was an important one for me. Not only did we have an election in Denmark, but we also had our first meetup at ngAarhus - a local Angular Usergroup that I started just months ago. I was hoping for 20 people to show up, but more than 50 people showed up. I am so exited! 

The first talk of the night was myself giving an introduction to Angular 2 (or just Angular). You can find the talk on [youtube right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6haa0MJc1w). As always you can find sample code-repo and other links from all talks and writings on the [links page](/links). All the talks and materials from ngAarhus are in Danish. 

Other than myself there were two brilliant talks by Stefan Schonert ([@schonert](https://twitter.com/schonert)) and Per Ploug ([@pploug](https://twitter.com/pploug)).

If you are an Angular developer and you're ever in Aarhus, make sure to join our group. Its a [public facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ngAarhus) where everyone can post, and there is a [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/ngaarhus) to follow for info.
